## Question
Kousen argues that conflict between managers and employees is inevitable. Often due to differing agendas, motivations for work, and structural incentives. If  employees should focus on making this conflict productive, to what extent does placing this responsibility on employees empower them to navigate real workplace dynamics?

Could it risk normalizing or excusing poor managerial behavior? How should employees decide when adaptation is productive versus when it becomes self-compromising in real-world scenarios?
