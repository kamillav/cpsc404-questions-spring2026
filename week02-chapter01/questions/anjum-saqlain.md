## Question

If conflict with a manager is *inevitable* because employee goals and manager goals only partially overlap, and managers are structurally pushed to prioritize the company’s financial agenda (“everything else is secondary”), what does “productive conflict” actually require from the employee: should you (a) translate *your* professional needs (autonomy, using strengths, learning/growth) into *their* money/risk language to earn support, or (b) insist on naming your agenda directly even when it doesn’t map cleanly to the bottom line, and where is the line between “managing the relationship” and quietly surrendering your own career goals?

## Context

Chapter 1 frames conflict as a “feature” of the employee/manager relationship that can be planned for and used to satisfy both sides, rather than treated as a one-time problem to “solve.” It also argues that what professionals often want from work (autonomy + strengths + development) may not align with what managers are evaluated on (contribution to the bottom line), and even when managers need your expertise or “professionals advise; managers decide,” meaning you can influence decisions without trying to usurp authority.
