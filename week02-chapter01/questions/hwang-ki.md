## Question

Why would a “professional” try to fulfill all the levels of hierarchy of needs at work, while they can just get safety needs and fulfill the higher needs outside work? This will allow professionals to align more closely with their managers and make both entities’ lives much easier.

## Context (optional)

I see many people who just go to work to make money, doing things as they are told, but then work on things they really care about after work, whether that's spending time with family, writing a book, or doing other things.
